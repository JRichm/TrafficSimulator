Road Network Architecture: graph based


    class RoadNetwork {
    private:
        std::vector<std::shared_ptr<RoadSegment>> roadSegments;
        std::vector<std::shared_ptr<Intersection>> intersections;
        std::vector<std::shared_ptr<SpawnPoint>> spawnPoints;
        std::vector<std::shared_ptr<Destination>> destinations;
    };





Road Segments
Each road segment would need to know:

Its shape (straight, curved)
Connection points (where it connects to intersections or other segments)
Lane configuration (number, direction, type - regular, exit-only, etc.)
Speed limit


    class RoadSegment {
    private:
        std::vector<Vector3> controlPoints; // For curved roads
        float speedLimit;
        int lanes;
        bool isBidirectional;
        std::weak_ptr<Junction> startJunction;
        std::weak_ptr<Junction> endJunction;
    };





Intersections are where road logic gets complex:

- Traffic light management
- Right-of-way rules
- Turn lanes

    class Intersection : public Junction {
    private:
        std::vector<std::shared_ptr<TrafficLight>> trafficLights;
        IntersectionType type; // roundabout, 4-way stop, signaled, etc.

        bool canVehicleProceed(Vehicle* vehicle);
    };





Vehicle Navigation
Cars would need a navigation system:

    class Vehicle {
    private:
        std::shared_ptr<Destination> destination;
        std::vector<std::shared_ptr<RoadSegment>> plannedRoute;
        void planRoute(std::shared_ptr<Destination> dest);
        void updateNavigation();
    };



Map Editor Considerations
For a map editor, consider:

A grid-based system to snap road pieces
Templates for common road configurations
Tools to set speed limits, lane counts, etc.
Validation to ensure roads properly connect





Vehicle Generators & Destinations

    class SpawnPoint {
    private:
        Vector3 position;
        std::shared_ptr<RoadSegment> connectedRoad;
        float spawnRate;
        std::vector<VehicleType> allowedVehicleTypes;
        std::map<std::shared_ptr<Destination>, float> destinationWeights;
        std::shared_ptr<Vehicle> generateVehicle();
    };
